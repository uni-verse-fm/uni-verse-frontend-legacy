        Welcome to Uni-verse. Uni-verse is more than just a platform for sharing and listening to music. It's a true social network and resource hub for music producers.<br/>

Our platform goes beyond the possibility of publishing, listening, commenting, grouping music into playlists, and consulting its statistics. <br/>
In addition to these features, it is possible to shazam, thanks to our mobile application in particular, the music published on the platform. <br/>

A system for sharing resources (samples, presets, etc.) specially adapted to the needs of producers has also been set up :<br/>
 it is possible to share their resources and use those of others. <br/>
Sharing is governed by a specific payment system: <br/>it is possible to offer resources for free, at a fixed price, or even to make them available<br/>
 to all other users who have already made donations (via the platform) of a value cumulative greater than or equal to a certain amount. 
So, mutual aid between artists is encouraged, as well as the sharing of resources, via a centralized platform, standardized for the first time, and adapted to the needs of producers.

An anti-plagiarism system been set up using the audio recognition algorithm (fingerprinting), to trace resources that are reposted. So, a notification is sent to the first Internet user, allowing him to accept or refuse the use of his resource.
